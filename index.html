    <h1>Philip Emeagwali</h1>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Philip Emeagwali is a Nigerian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist" style="text-decoration: none">computer scientist</a>. He has been living in the United States
        <br> for many years.[1] He won the 1989 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Bell_Prize" style="text-decoration: none">Gordon Bell Prize</a> ($1,000) for price-performance in
        <br>high-performance computing applications, in an oil reservoir modeling calculation using a
        <br> novel mathematical formulation and implementation.[2][3]
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Emeagwali was born in Akure, Nigeria on 23 August 1954.[4] His early schooling was suspended
        <br> in 1967 as a result of the Nigerian Civil War. At 13 years, he served in the Biafran army. After the war
        <br> he completed high-school equivalence through self-study.
        <br>He is married to Dale Brown Emeagwali, a noted African-American microbiologist.[5] </p>
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>He traveled to the United States to study under a scholarship following completion of a
        <br>correspondence course at the University of London. He received a bachelor's degree in
        <br>mathematics from Oregon State University in 1977. He later moved to Washington DC, receiving
        <br>in 1986 a master's degree from George Washington University in ocean and marine engineering,
        <br>and a second master's in applied mathematics from the University of Maryland. Next magazine
        <br>suggested that Emeagwali claimed to have further degrees.[6][7] During this time, he worked as a
        <br>civil engineer at the Bureau of Land Reclamation in Wyoming.
    </p>
    <h3>Court case and the denial of degree</h3>
    <p>Emeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan from 1987 through 1991.
        <br>His thesis was not accepted by a committee of internal and external examiners and thus he was
        <br> not awarded the degree. Emeagwali filed a court challenge, stating that the decision was a
        <br>violation of his civil rights and that the university had discriminated against him in several ways
        <br>because of his race. The court challenge was dismissed, as was an appeal to the Michigan state
        <br>Court of Appeals.[8]
    </p>
    <h2>Supercomputing</h2>
    <p>Emeagwali received the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize for an application of the CM-2 massively-parallel
        <br>computer. The application used computational fluid dynamics for oil-reservoir modeling. He
        <br>received a prize in "price/performance" category, with a performance figure of about 400
        <br> Mflops/$1M.[15] The winner in the "performance" category, was also the winner of the
        <br> Price/performance category, but unable to receive two prizes. Mobil Research and Thinking
        <br>Machines, used the CM-2 for seismic data processing and achieved the higher ratio of 500
        <br>Mflops/$1M. The judges decided on one award per entry.[3][2] His method involved each
        <br>microprocessor communicating with six neighbors.[10]
        <br>
        <br>Emeagwali's simulation was the first program to apply a pseudo-time approach to reservoir
        <br>modeling.[1]</p>
